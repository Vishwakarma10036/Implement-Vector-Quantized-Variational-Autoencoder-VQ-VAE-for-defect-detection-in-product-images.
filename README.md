# Implement-Vector-Quantized-Variational-Autoencoder-VQ-VAE-for-defect-detection-in-product-images.
This project implements a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for automated defect detection in product images, leveraging the power of unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in industrial and manufacturing workflows.

The VQ-VAE is a type of generative model that combines variational inference with vector quantization to learn discrete latent representations of image data. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VQ-VAE encodes input images into discrete latent codes, which improves the quality and interpretability of reconstructions, making it suitable for applications like anomaly detection.

# How It Works
The model is trained exclusively on defect-free (normal) product images. During training, it learns the distribution and structural patterns of these normal images. At inference time, the model attempts to reconstruct new input images. Since it has never seen defective samples, it fails to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions, resulting in higher reconstruction errors in those areas.

By computing the pixel-wise difference between the original and reconstructed image, we can highlight defective regions, making this approach highly effective for localizing and identifying defects without any need for labeled defect data.

# Key Features
> Implementation of the full VQ-VAE architecture using PyTorch
> Reconstruction error-based anomaly detection for defect identification
> Support for custom datasets of product images
> Visualization tools to compare original, reconstructed, and anomaly maps
> Can be extended for real-time industrial inspection systems

# Applications
> Quality inspection in manufacturing lines
> Anomaly detection in packaging, electronics, and mechanical parts
> Visual inspection automation where labeled defect data is limited or unavailable
> This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution to detect and localize defects, reducing human effort and enhancing inspection reliability. The project can be easily customized for different types of products by training on relevant image datasets.
